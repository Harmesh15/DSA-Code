You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array.
An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. 
The rightmost element is always a leader.


 function test(nums){
 let arr = [];
    let n = nums.length;
    arr.push(nums[n - 1]);
    for (let i = n-2; i >=0; i--) {
        if (nums[i] >= arr[arr.length-1]) {
            arr.push(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    arr.reverse();
    return arr; 
 }
 
let nums = [16,17,4,3,5,2];
console.log(test(nums));
